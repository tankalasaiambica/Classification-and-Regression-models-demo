Classification and Regression both belong to Supervised Learning

Classification : When you want to classify outcomes into different classes. For example – whether the floor needs cleaning/mopping is a classification problem. The outcome can fall into one of the classes – Yes or No.

Regression : When you are interested in answering how much – these problems would fall under the Regression umbrella. For example – how much cleaning needs to be done is a Regression problem.
